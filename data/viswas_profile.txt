My name is Viswas Chowdary Kovi. I am an AI/ML Engineer with expertise in generative AI, deep learning, and NLP. I have worked with GANs, transformers, and LLMs.

My programming skills include Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, OpenCV, Flask, and FastAPI. I have experience with AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, and Apache Spark.

I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from VIT University, Chennai (2019–2023), and I am pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Hertfordshire, UK (2025–2027).

I’ve completed internships at:
- Amara Raja Power Systems (AI tools, predictive maintenance)
- Webengers (React.js, performance optimization)
- The Sparks Foundation (predictive analytics, data visualization)
- Smart Internz (ML models, feature engineering)

Projects I've worked on include:
- Car Damage Detection using computer vision
- A RAG-based GenAI Chatbot
- AI filters for image inpainting and restoration
- Smart health prediction (e.g., tuberculosis detection)
- Deploying LLMs in AI Experience Centers

Certifications:
- Machine Learning (Stanford University)
- Python Data Structures (University of Michigan)

I enjoy building AI solutions from scratch, including data pipelines, web scraping tools, and full-stack deployments. I also have web dev experience (React.js, REST APIs).

Outside of tech, I was a technical team member of the Sports Club at VIT Chennai. I’ve also participated in hackathons and won runner-up for building AI-powered automation tools.
